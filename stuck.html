<i>Bernard and Heather are in the lift waiting for the doors to close. Helena rushes in to join them </i><p>

<font color="#0000FF">Helena:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh thanks for holding the doors<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bernard:</font color="#0000FF"> No problem. Good morning<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Helena:</font color="#0000FF"> Good morning<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Heather:</font color="#0000FF"> Hello<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bernard:</font color="#0000FF"> Beautiful day<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Helena: </font color="#0000FF">Yes it is. I have been in such a rush today though, glad I made it on time<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Heather: </font color="#0000FF">Monday's always seem to be a rush for me<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bernard: </font color="#0000FF">Me too<p>
( The lift doors close)<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Helena:</font color="#0000FF"> I forgot, I need the Sixteenth floor<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bernard: </font color="#0000FF">It's ok I already selected that one<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Helena:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh good<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Heather: </font color="#0000FF">I need that floor too<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Helena:</font color="#0000FF"> Is it my imagination or is this lift making a strange noise?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bernard:</font color="#0000FF"> Hmm, yes, it does sound a bit strange<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Heather; </font color="#0000FF">I think you are right. I hope there is nothing wrong<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bernard:</font color="#0000FF"> I am sure there isn't. Different lifts have different sounds I suppose<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Helena: </font color="#0000FF">True, not sure I have ever heard a noise like this though<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> Heather: </font color="#0000FF">We are still moving so I would guess it's ok<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bernard: </font color="#0000FF">Yes that is normally a good sign that everything is ok<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Helena: </font color="#0000FF">Let's hope so<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Heather:</font color="#0000FF"> I hate lifts but I wasn't going to use the stairs for the sixteenth floor<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bernard:</font color="#0000FF"> Especially on Monday morning<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Heather:</font color="#0000FF"> Exactly<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Helena: </font color="#0000FF">Is it getting louder?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Heather:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes, I think it is<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bernard:</font color="#0000FF"> Maybe just because we are getting higher. It might me quite normal<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Helena:</font color="#0000FF"> I don't think so<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Heather: </font color="#0000FF">I don't think so either<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Helena: </font color="#0000FF">In fact I am finding it quite worrying<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bernard: </font color="#0000FF">You could be right, maybe we should get off at the next floor and get the other lift<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Heather: </font color="#0000FF">Yes, That's a good idea. I don't feel very safe in this one<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bernard: </font color="#0000FF">The next floor is seven, I'll press the button for that<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Helena: </font color="#0000FF">(frightened) Oh my gosh!!! We've stopped<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bernard: </font color="#0000FF">Don't panic, we are quite safe<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Heather:</font color="#0000FF">Push it again! Actually push anything to try to get it moving<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bernard:</font color="#0000FF"> I am trying but nothing makes any difference<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Helena: </font color="#0000FF">Look, there is an emergency button. Push that and lets get some help<p>


<u><i><font color="#FF0000">Scene two â€“ The maintenance room. Bill and Fran are just about to start their lunch.</i></u></font color="#FF0000"><p>

<font color="#0000FF">Bill: </font color="#0000FF">What do you have in your sandwiches today Fran?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Fran: </font color="#0000FF">Cheese<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bill </font color="#0000FF">I have tuna and cucumber<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Fran.</font color="#0000FF"> That's nice. I only ever get cheese<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bill: </font color="#0000FF">Cheese can be nice<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Fran: </font color="#0000FF">Yes, but not every day<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bill: </font color="#0000FF">True<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Fran: </font color="#0000FF">Shall I make some tea?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bill: </font color="#0000FF">Yes. Good idea. Nice and strong for me please<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Fran:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes, I remember<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bill: </font color="#0000FF">I only said that because the last one you made I could see the bottom of the cup<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Fran: </font color="#0000FF">You could make it yourself if you don't like it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bill; </font color="#0000FF">I can't do that. It's your job to make the tea, not mine<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Fran:</font color="#0000FF"> Alright, alright I'll make it stronger<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bill: </font color="#0000FF">That's the spirit<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Fran: </font color="#0000FF">If I make you a nice strong tea can I have one of you tuna sandwiches?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bill: </font color="#0000FF">No you jolly well can't. You stick to your cheese<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Fran: </font color="#0000FF">Thanks for nothing<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bill:</font color="#0000FF"> Get on and make that tea <p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Crabtree:</font color="#0000FF"> Coo weee. It's only me<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bill:</font color="#0000FF"> Hello Miss Crabtree. We don't often see you down here. What can we do for you.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Crabtree:</font color="#0000FF"> Hello Bill. There is a problem with one of the lifts<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bill:</font color="#0000FF"> The East lift?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Crabtree:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes that's the one<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Fran:</font color="#0000FF"> I noticed it was making a funny noise yesterday<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bill:</font color="#0000FF"> Well why didn't you say something you muppet<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Fran: </font color="#0000FF">I forgot<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Crabtree: </font color="#0000FF">There are three people stuck in it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bill: </font color="#0000FF">They won't come to any harm<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Fran: </font color="#0000FF">The lift won't go anywhere<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Crabtree: </font color="#0000FF">That is what they are worried about. So can you two make it go somewhere? Preferably up. Which is where they were heading<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bill: </font color="#0000FF">Yes Miss Crabtree, we can soon sort that out. Not a difficult job<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Crabtree: </font color="#0000FF">That's good. They sounded quite panicky when we spoke through the door<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Fran; </font color="#0000FF">So it's stuck by the doors then?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Crabtree:</font color="#0000FF"> No, just the bottom bit of the lift is by the door. I can see their feet through that little window<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Fran: </font color="#0000FF">That's a little more difficult<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bill; </font color="#0000FF">Not much. We'll soon have them out<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Crabtree:</font color="#0000FF"> Can you come now then Bill<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bill: </font color="#0000FF">Not now Miss Crabtree, we've just started lunch<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Crabtree: </font color="#0000FF">But it is an emergency Bill<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Fran: </font color="#0000FF">It's only an emergency Miss Crabtree if loss of life is involved<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bill:</font color="#0000FF"> Fran is right for once. Is anyone dying in the lift?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Crabtree:</font color="#0000FF"> Not as far as I know.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Fran:</font color="#0000FF"> In that case, it is lunch first<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Crabtree: </font color="#0000FF">One of them is feeling a little queezy<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Fran: </font color="#0000FF">Not the same as dying though is it?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bill: </font color="#0000FF">Quite right. Not the same thing at all<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Fran: </font color="#0000FF">Cup of tea Miss Crabtree?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Crabtree</font color="#0000FF"> ( A little worried) Errr, no, no thank you.
 I had better get back up there and tell them what's happening<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Fran: </font color="#0000FF">Ok, see you later <p>


<i><u><font color="#FF0000">Scene three:  The Lift</i></u></font color="#FF0000"><p>

<font color="#0000FF">Miss Crabtree: </font color="#0000FF">Hello! Can you hear me?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bernard: </font color="#0000FF">Yes we can hear you<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Heather: </font color="#0000FF">Did you manage to get some help?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Crabtree:</font color="#0000FF"> Well yes, in a way<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Helena: </font color="#0000FF">What do you mean in a way?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Crabtree: </font color="#0000FF">I contacted the maintenance team<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bernard: </font color="#0000FF">Are they on their way?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Crabtree: </font color="#0000FF">Errr, not quite<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Helena:</font color="#0000FF"> Where do they have to come from then?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Crabtree: </font color="#0000FF">The maintenance room<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Heather:</font color="#0000FF"> And where's that?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Crabtree: </font color="#0000FF">It's in the basement<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bernard: </font color="#0000FF">So why does it take so long to get from the basement<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Crabtree: </font color="#0000FF">They are having their lunch<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Helena: </font color="#0000FF">( a little incredulous) But we are stuck in a lift<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Crabtree: </font color="#0000FF">Yes, they do know that<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bernard:</font color="#0000FF"> I would feel sorry they would have to leave their lunch but this is an emergency<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Crabtree:  </font color="#0000FF">Apparently it isn't<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Heather: </font color="#0000FF">Why not:<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Crabtree: </font color="#0000FF"> Because you are not dying<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Helena: </font color="#0000FF">I do feel very queezy though<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Crabtree:</font color="#0000FF">  I did mention that but it seems it's not the same as dying<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bernard: </font color="#0000FF">Granted it is not the same as dying but I do think they ought to leave their lunch and get us out<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Crabtree: </font color="#0000FF"> In all honesty I think that too but they would not be budged<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bernard: </font color="#0000FF">And it seems we won't be either<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Heather: </font color="#0000FF">No, we are stuck till after lunch for goodness sake!<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Helena:</font color="#0000FF"> Isn't there anything you can do?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Crabtree:</font color="#0000FF">  Oh no, no, I know nothing about lifts. It's not my department <p>
<font color="#0000FF">Heather: </font color="#0000FF">Isn't there some way we can get ourselves out? Like through a trap door?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bernard: </font color="#0000FF">If you look up you will see there is no trap door. That only happens in lifts in movies. They never exist in real life.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Helena: </font color="#0000FF">Why not? <p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bernard: </font color="#0000FF">Too dangerous<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Heather: </font color="#0000FF">Excuse me miss, do you think you could go and ask them again? Tell them we are pleading?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Crabtree:</font color="#0000FF">  I could try but I am not at all sure I can convince them<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Helena: </font color="#0000FF">Maybe we could pretend one of us is dying<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Crabtree:</font color="#0000FF"> Hmm that would be quite deceitful<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Heather:</font color="#0000FF"> It may get us out though<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bernard: </font color="#0000FF">Suppose I offered him twenty pounds? You see, I have a very urgent appointment<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Helena:</font color="#0000FF"> So do I, and I am going to be late<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Heather: </font color="#0000FF">And I am going to be late for my appointment too, and it is very important.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Crabtree:</font color="#0000FF"> Ok I will try but I am still not sure they will leave their lunch<p>

<i><u><font color="#FF0000">Scene four:  The Maintenance room</i></u></font color="#FF0000"><p>

<font color="#0000FF">Bill: </font color="#0000FF">That was a nice cup of tea Fran. See if you can make it like that every time<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Fran. </font color="#0000FF">Ok, I'll try.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bill: </font color="#0000FF">What do you think about this lift then? What are we going to do about it?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Fran: </font color="#0000FF">We're still having lunch<p>
 <font color="#0000FF">Bill: </font color="#0000FF">I meant after lunch. I have been trying to teach you the tricks of the trade so tell me, what will we do?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Fran:</font color="#0000FF"> Ohh I see what you mean<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bill: </font color="#0000FF">So imagine I am not here and you are the only one on duty. What would you do?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Fran: </font color="#0000FF">Errrrrr... I'd get a crowbar and and lever open the doors<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bill: </font color="#0000FF">You muppet. What good would that do?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Fran: </font color="#0000FF">Well, I'd try to get them out<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bill: </font color="#0000FF">No, no, no. You can't do it like that<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Fran:</font color="#0000FF"> Why not?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bill:</font color="#0000FF"> Several reasons, One. You will damage the door, and they are very expensive to replace, which would not make you not very popular. Two. They are stuck between floors so would have to climb out. They could hurt themselves and sue the company. And three. We don't have a crowbar<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Fran: </font color="#0000FF">Ahh ok<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bill: </font color="#0000FF">So completely the wrong idea there<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Fran:</font color="#0000FF"> I know!! We go up to the top of the lift shaft and winch it up by hand.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bill: </font color="#0000FF">Oh my goodness me! Have I taught you so little in the 
the last three months?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Fran: </font color="#0000FF">Well it was just and idea<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bill: </font color="#0000FF">And a very bad one. We would almost break our backs doing that and we don't get paid enough to almost break our backs<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Fran: </font color="#0000FF">Ok, So what do we do then?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bill:</font color="#0000FF"> Simple. We replace the fuse?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Fran: </font color="#0000FF">Replace the fuse??<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bill: </font color="#0000FF">Yes, that's all that's wrong<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Fran:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh, I see. But what about that funny noise<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bill:</font color="#0000FF"> I know what that is<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Fran: </font color="#0000FF">What?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bill: </font color="#0000FF">I was up in the lift house yesterday and dropped a spanner on top of the lift. I forgot to get it back so that noise will be my spanner rattling on top of the lift<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Fran: </font color="#0000FF">So it will be an easy job then?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bill:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes a very easy one<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Crabtree: </font color="#0000FF">Cooo wee. Only me again<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bill:</font color="#0000FF"> Hello again Miss Crabtree. How are the trapped people doing<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Crabtree:</font color="#0000FF"> All right I suppose but very anxious to get out<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Fran: </font color="#0000FF">Yes, I suppose they are<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Crabtree:</font color="#0000FF"> Have you finished lunch yet?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bill:</font color="#0000FF"> Not quite but almost there<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Crabtree:</font color="#0000FF"> A gentlemen in the lift said he would give you twenty ponds if you can get them out a bit quicker. They all have urgent appointments<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bill: </font color="#0000FF">That is very generous of him and I'll accept<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Fran:  </font color="#0000FF">Ten pounds each.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bill: </font color="#0000FF">You must be joking, you were going to use a crowbar<p>
<i><u><font color="#FF0000">Scene five:  The Lift</u></i></font color="#FF0000"><p>

<font color="#0000FF">Heather:</font color="#0000FF"> Do you think the maintenance man will come now?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bernard: </font color="#0000FF">Depends how much he wants twenty pounds<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Helena:</font color="#0000FF"> Are you still feeling queezy?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Heather. </font color="#0000FF">No not so bad now but I just want to get out of this stupid lift<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bernard:</font color="#0000FF"> Hopefully it shouldn't be long now<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Heather: </font color="#0000FF">I wonder how they will get us out?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Helena: </font color="#0000FF">I don't know. Maybe they will prise the doors open with a crowbar<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bernard: </font color="#0000FF">I don't think they will do that<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Helena: </font color="#0000FF"></font color="#0000FF">I am going to be so late<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Heather: </font color="#0000FF">Me too<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bernard: </font color="#0000FF">I am supposed to be at a job interview<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Helena: </font color="#0000FF">That's funny, so am I<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Heather: </font color="#0000FF">I also have a job interview. It's with Noble And Parkes<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bernard: </font color="#0000FF">So is mine<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Helena:</font color="#0000FF"> Me too. Wow! We are all here for the same interview<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Heather:</font color="#0000FF"> Accounts Director?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Helena: </font color="#0000FF">Yes. Is that the job you are being interviewed for?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Heather: </font color="#0000FF">Yes<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bernard: </font color="#0000FF">And the one I am here for too<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Helena:</font color="#0000FF"> Well, at least we are all late so nobody gets the advantage of arriving before the others.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bernard: </font color="#0000FF">My name is Bernard by the way<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Helena:</font color="#0000FF"> I am Helena<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Heather:</font color="#0000FF"> And I am Heather <p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bernard: </font color="#0000FF">As much as I want this job, I wish you both the best of luck<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Heather:</font color="#0000FF"> And the best of luck to you too Bernard<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Helena: </font color="#0000FF">Good luck to both of you<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bernard: </font color="#0000FF">Let's hope one of us gets the job, we deserve it after this<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Heather: </font color="#0000FF">We certainly do<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Crabtree:</font color="#0000FF"> Hello, can you hear me?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bernard:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes we can hear you<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Crabtree:</font color="#0000FF"> Good. I have Bill the maintenance man here with me and he will be releasing you very soon.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bill:</font color="#0000FF"> Good morning ladies and gentlemen<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bernard: </font color="#0000FF">You are going to get us out?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bill: </font color="#0000FF">Yes I am sir<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Heather:</font color="#0000FF"> I hope you both had a nice lunch<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Fran: </font color="#0000FF">Not really, cheese again<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Helena:</font color="#0000FF"> Will you be using a crowbar to open the door?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Fran: </font color="#0000FF">Absolutely not, that would be a crazy idea<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bill: </font color="#0000FF">It certainly would<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Fran:</font color="#0000FF"> Only an idiot would do that<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bill:</font color="#0000FF"> I have located the problem and have executed a swift repair but I need you now to do something inside the lift<p>
